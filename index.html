        <h1>Welcome to my software toolshed!</h1>
        <p>This website is basically a accumulative list of all softwares I (x_xorg) have used over the span of my life time on the internet. I will try my best to make them all as <b>private, opensource, secure, and free</b> as possible. However, with the growing internet and tech industry, alot of issues have been a rising thing in society making that no longer an option. The software that I use that will not be those characteristics will be tagged with whatever they are not. Most likely tagged with "Not Opensource" or "Not Private" since those ones are that big tech is getting rid of due to the rise of preprietary garbage and data harvesting b.s. for their advertising campaignes. </p>
        <p>I even tried to make accessing this website as private and opensource as possible, all the code is opensource and everything. The only issues there <i>might</i> be is the hosting service.[future x_xorg here: uh I wrote thinking I'd be hosting this on some random hosting service and using a godaddy url. Currently this site is a Github Pages Link so you'll just have to worry about Microsoft's butt fucking software sooooooooooo idk. Ill fix later] I could self host ig but I probably won't be as reliable since Im broke asf and do not have such money for electricity and amazing internet access(despite being in the country that invented the internetðŸ™„). But I do promise this website gets nothing out of you. No Ads, no trackers, no cookies, and no javascript.</p>
